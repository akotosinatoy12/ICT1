This quarter, I've experienced a lot of difficulties in transitioning into Grade 9. But at the same time, 
it felt familiar to me and I didn't have that much of a struggle 
at all. There were a lot of new faces for me, and a lot of new people to meet. My first impression of Grade 9 was how kind the teachers were, and I felt very comfortable. It felt very easy-going, compared to grade 8. This was when I realized that in grade 9, I have to start becoming serious in my studies. I've experienced pressure again because of how many outputs, or things we need to pass. But I know it's just only the beginning.

In ICT, I've learnt a lot of new things in HTML, like hyperlinks, tables, lists, and forms, which I have not yet the knowledge before. Hands-on activities were very pressuirng though, because of the time. At the same time, if I don't have notes for the codes, it'll be really hard to do it. But when done with a partner, or a pairwork, I can do my best to help my partner in making a webpage.

Overall, I think 1st quarter was a little "okay" for me. But I still expect that the upcoming quarters will be much harder than this quarter. I should be mentally and physically prepared for it. I will try to practice more on coding this next quarter, so that I can do my hands-on activities well now.
